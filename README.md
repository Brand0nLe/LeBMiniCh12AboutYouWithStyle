Mini Challenge 12 - About You With Style

Create a website with HTML tags and include a css file with styling. The details will include some facts about myself, my favorite foods, and I also included pictures as well. There is a link to my Github as well.


# Peer Review: Pedro Castaneda
Awesome work! I like the use of multiple pictures and your code is well structured and clean. One suggestion I would make is adding a <hr> tag to define the sections fo your webpage.
